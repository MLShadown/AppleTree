# AppleTree
MMP_Web_Development

The story is about an apple tree. I was inspired by an apple tree in my childhood home while creating this story.
The most challenging part of this project was adjusting the CSS to make the webpage more harmonious.
I solved this issue by experimenting with various color and layout combinations.
